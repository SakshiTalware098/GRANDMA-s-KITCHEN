"Grandma's Kitchen is a cake bakery website offering a variety of delicious baking recipes for cakes."

Needed Softwares for working of website :

 1) XAMPP control panel v3.3.0
 2) Visual Studio Code

Firstly we need to make sure that all the files downloaded by you should be stored in a particular folder named as : 

~ "Cake0.1"

Now the Cake0.1 folder created should be present in htdocs folder, and for this htdocs folder go into your file explorer and within file explorer fo the following path : 

~ "C:\xampp\htdocs"

Once all your files are set into htdocs folder go ahead with the steps as...

Open XAMPP control panel and.. 
~ Go for the Admin option of MySql module 
~ Now you will get redirected to Chrome and get the interface of phpMyadmin 
~ Within this interface, Create a new database named as cake 
~ Within cake database create new table and 
 : for new table import the sql file named as 
  ~ contact.sql 
 : also do create another table for same cake database and do import the other sql file named as 
  ~ cake.sql
 : and one lastfile to be imported in cake data database named as 
  ~ reviews(1).sql

And here your SETUP is done!!!!!!

Now simply open new tab in chrome and type the following command : http://localhost/Cake0.1/login.php

And there we go.. here's your WEBSITE ready for uhh.

THANK YOU!
